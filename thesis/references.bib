It could inhibit statistical analysis process and might give a bias conclusion from the analysis if couldn't be handled properly. This problem can be found on some linear regression analysis. One way to handle this problem is using multiple imputation (MI) method named Predictive Mean Matching (PMM). PMM will matching the predictive mean distance of incomplete observations with the complete observations. To get the multiple imputation concept, the predictive mean of incomplete observations were estimated by Bayesian approach while the complete observations were estimated with ordinary least square. Thus, the complete observation that has the closest distance will be a donor value for the incomplete one. Simulation data with two variable (x and y), univariate missing data pattern (on y), and MAR mechanism is used to analyzed the effectiveness of PMM based on relative efficiency estimation result of missing covariate data. Regression analysis used x as independent variable and y as dependent variable. The result showed that PMM give a significant coefficient regression parameter at 5\% level of significance and only loss 1 \% of relative efficiency.},

The main hypothesis is that an increase in the minimum wage has a negative effect on total factor productivity (TFP) due to the existence of labor adjustment costs. Using data from Chilean manufacturing plants for the period 1992\textendash 2005 and a difference-in-differences methodology, we find that an increase in minimum wage had a negative effect on TFP. Our estimates indicate that a real increase of about 22\% in the minimum wage during the period 1998\textendash 2000 reduced TFP by 5.8\% in low unskilled-intensive industries and 9.7\% in high unskilled-intensive industries. These results are robust to alternative measures of productivity and to the inclusion of several covariates to avoid confounding effects of other policy changes or firms' exposure to minimum wage changes.},

Panel co-integration test indicates that there is a long-run relationship between the variables. In the long-run, LFP positively related to the economic growth, and negatively related to RMWs. The unemployment is positively related to both the economic growth and RMWs. In the short-run, RMWS has a significant and positive effect on economic growth. The unemployment and LFP have a negative and significant effect on RMWs. LFP has a negative and significant effect on unemployment and RMWs has a positive and significant effect on LFP. Furthermore, economic growth has a negative and significant effect on LFP. The result of Granger causality test points out that there is a bidirectional causality relationship between economic growth and RMWs and between RMWs and LFP. In addition, unemployment rate causes RMWs, and LFP causes unemployment.},

  abstract = {After a long period of unstable and low economic activity, Brazil achieved a relatively high economic growth with low inflation from 2004 to 2008, when the world scenario was favourable for the Brazilian trade balance due to rising commodity prices and growing external demand. An incomes policy, focused on real increases in the minimum wage along with a credit boom, led to a decade of high consumption growth rates. Increases in consumption and exports, in turn, induced investment and stimulated manufacturing production, despite the real appreciation of the national currency. However, the Great Recession that emerged after the global financial crisis of 2007/2008 brought challenges to the Brazilian economic performance, with unpleasant consequences for the country's GDP growth. Consumption, investment and exports have decelerated, despite anti-cyclical macroeconomic policies. In this setting, manufacturing production stagnated and GDP growth slowed down substantially, while imports continued rising considerably. The aim of this paper is to provide an explanation to the slowdown of Brazilian growth rates after the Great Recession. The main hypothesis is that consumption was the main source of effective demand in the country since 2003. However, Brazil has not yet been able to sustain manufacturing and economic growth without a more active government policy to stimulate productive investment. Consumption increased due to an incomes policy that raised minimum wage, stimulating investment, but this increase in consumption was not enough to sustain investment growth, because the impact of the great recession on the Brazilian economy. Consequently, higher consumption, though in lower growth rates, took place with rising imports. In order to understand better all these relations, the paper estimates the equations for consumption and imports and relate them to the investment and GDP growth performances.},

Calibrations suggest the growth surplus can be significant. An empirical study on 11 OECD countries illustrates these results.

  abstract = {There has been considerable discussion of the role of institutions in development, including regional development, since the early 1990s with the work of North in 1990 followed by major interventions from Amin and Thrift in 1995 and other researchers. In large measure this set of literature has focused on evaluating and describing the `institutional thickness' of places, the relative richness or poverty of institutional structures that support economic activity and growth. While much discussed, this concept has struggled when considered quantitatively. Some authors have noted that regions can have too much institutional thickness, with agencies and government entities `crowding' each other out and distracting growth efforts. Recently Rodriguez-Pose in 2013 has argued that there is a need to reconsider this set of concepts, and that there should be a focus on institutional effectiveness, not thickness. This paper takes up the challenge of measuring both institutional thickness and institutional effectiveness for Australia, producing an index at the level of local government areas (LGAs) and the territories of Regional Development Australia Committees. This disaggregated picture of effectiveness results in insights that highlight the importance of state structures, the relative advantage of metropolitan location, the pivotal role of political influence and the capacity of regions to shape their own future.},

The data used is monthly and covers the period from January 2005 to March 2017. The producer price index represents prices and the industrial production index represents growth. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is used to see the effect of the minimum wage on these variables. An error-correctionbased Granger causality test is then conducted to see short-run and long-run causalities. The bounds test yields evidence of a long-run relationship between variables. The obtained ARDL results also show that while the minimum wage has a statistically significant effect on unemployment and prices, it does not have a statistically significant effect on production. While there is short-run causality from minimum wage to prices only, the obtained significant error correction terms indicate long-run causality for all of the variables. Consequently, the minimum wage plays a significant role in increasing prices and the number of unemployed people in Turkey. \textcopyright{} 2019, University of Belgrade.},

The innovation index is applied to rank-order various industrial sector and changes in innovation characteristics over time are indicated by index values determined for 1960, 1963 and 1970. Relationships are established between values of the innovation index and interindustry differences in the dynamics of the development of markets created through technological innovation. Application of these relationships for projecting the rate at which markets will develop for new technological innovations is discussed.},

A simple matching model shows that an increase in wages in the informal sector may also be induced by significant sorting and composition effects between the formal and the shadow sectors in the aftermath of the increase in the minimum wage. Using data on Brazil, we find that sorting accounts for at least one third of the increase in average wages in the informal sector after a minimum wage hike. This contribution of endogenous sorting to wage dynamics in the informal sector is also increasing over time.},

We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the estimator, propose tools for inference, and develop tests for identifying assumptions. Extensions include time-varying controls, triple-differences, and certain non-binary treatments. We show the practical relevance of these insights in a simulation study and an application. Studying the consumption response to tax rebates in the United States, we find that the notional marginal propensity to consume is between 8 and 11 percent in the first quarter -- about half as large as benchmark estimates used to calibrate macroeconomic models -- and predominantly occurs in the first month after the rebate.},

To accomplish that we employ a decomposition method that gauges the contribution of the increases in the minimum wage that occurred in recent decades in Brazil through the labor and nonlabor sources of household income. The results show that the minimum wage had a contribution of 64 percent to the observed fall in income inequality between 1995 and 2014 and that pensions were the most relevant channel over this period.},

This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

  abstract = {We estimate the effect of minimum wages on low-wage jobs using 138 prominent state-level minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016 in the United States using a difference-in-differences approach. We first estimate the effect of the minimum wage increase on employment changes by wage bins throughout the hourly wage distribution. We then focus on the bottom part of the wage distribution and compare the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the missing jobs paying below it to infer the employment effect. We find that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the five years following the increase. At the same time, the direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic groups show that the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of the wage distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradeable sectors. We also show how decomposing the overall employment effect by wage bins allows a transparent way of assessing the plausibility of estimates.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Using data from the Canadian census, researchers at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy sought to create an area-based socio-economic measure (ABSM). The degree of association between the ABSM and health was evaluated. Methods: Values on several census variables (including income, education, employment and family structure) were captured at the enumeration-area or dissemination-area level and submitted to a principal components factor analysis to create three ABSMs: an updated version of the Socio-economic Factor Index (SEFI-2) and modified versions of Pampalon's material deprivation and social deprivation indices. Factor scores from these analyses were then compared with several population health measures: Premature Mortality Rate (PMR), Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL), life expectancy, and selfrated health. Results: SEFI-2 scores were strongly related not only to the other ABSMs but also to every measure of health status. The strongest correlations between an ABSM and health measure were for SEFI-2 and PYLL(r=0.85), and SEFI-2 and PMR (r=0.80). The weakest correlations were found with the social deprivation ABSM measure and the self-rated health measure. Conclusions: ABSMs based on measures from the Canadian census are a valuable resource to population health researchers. Importantly, depending on the research question and reason for the inclusion of an ABSM, these composite measures may perform better than a simple measure of income alone. The ability to adjust for socio-economic status when assessing population health status or population health interventions contributes to the validity of conclusions drawn when conducting this type of research, and ABSMs may be able to substitute for area health status where it may not be easily determined.}

Multilevel analysis was done to identify the relationship between the perceived level of housing problem and PCS and MCS by clustering by sex. Compared to those who always felt unsafe at home due to interior design problem, participants who never felt unsafe showed an average of 10.51 (95\% CI = 7.69\textendash 13.34, p {$<$} 0.0001) and 5.78 (95\% CI = 2.90\textendash 8.65, p {$<$} 0.0001) higher physical and mental component score (better quality of life), respectively.

The PCA-based economic policy uncertainty index is found to be positively related with the volatility and correlation of the global financial market, which indicates that the stock markets are more volatile and correlated when the global economic policy uncertainty is higher. The PCA-based global economic policy uncertainty index (T=24) performs slightly better because the relationships between the PCA-based uncertainty and market volatility and between the PCA-based uncertainty and market correlation are more significant.},

This article shows that the expansion of the minimum wage played a critical role in this decline. The 1966 Fair Labor Standards Act extended federal minimum wage coverage to agriculture, restaurants, nursing homes, and other services that were previously uncovered and where nearly a third of black workers were employed. We digitize over 1,000 hourly wage distributions from Bureau of Labor Statistics industry wage reports and use CPS microdata to investigate the effects of this reform on wages, employment, and racial inequality. Using a cross-industry difference-in-differences design, we show that earnings rose sharply for workers in the newly covered industries. The impact was nearly twice as large for black workers as for white workers. Within treated industries, the racial gap adjusted for observables fell from 25 log points prereform to 0 afterward. We can rule out significant disemployment effects for black workers. Using a bunching design, we find no aggregate effect of the reform on employment. The 1967 extension of the minimum wage can explain more than 20\% of the reduction in the racial earnings and income gap during the civil rights era. Our findings shed new light on the dynamics of labor market inequality in the United States and suggest that minimum wage policy can play a critical role in reducing racial economic disparities.},

Our context is the Brazilian economy, characterized by persistently large racial disparities and the availability of detailed labor force surveys and administrative matched employeremployee data with information on race. We analyze the effect of large increases in the minimum wage that occurred between 1999 and 2009. Using a variety of research designs and identification strategies, we obtain three main findings. First, the increase in the minimum wage erased the racial earnings gap up to the 10th percentile of the national wage distribution and up to the 30th percentile in the lowest wage region, the Northeast. Second, there is no evidence of significant reallocation of workers from the formal sector to the informal sector. This can be explained by the fact that the minimum wage is de facto binding in the informal sector (excluding agriculture, domestic workers, and the self-employed). Third, we do not find evidence of significant dis-employment effects, or of white-nonwhite labor-labor substitution. As a result, the minimum wage increases of the 2000s led to a large decline in the economy-wide racial income gap in Brazil.},

Identification of invoking a NMW is possible by reference to a pre-period (prior to 1999) without a NMW. Separate identification of the effect of incremental changes (and year interaction effects) in the NMW is facilitated by variation in the bite of the NMW across local labour markets. We address the issues of possible endogeneity and dynamic structure of employment rate changes, regional demand side shocks induced by the recession, and take account of the spatial dependence of local labour markets. Using system GMM, we conclude that there is no discernable effect of the NMW introduction or its uprating on employment but show how more na\"ive estimation may have revealed the various widely different positive and negative effects found in the literature.},

The authors find that the policy increased worker pay and compressed wage inequality, but did not create any detectable employment loss among affected restaurants. The authors also find smaller amounts of measurement error than characterized the earlier studies, and so they can reject previous negative employment estimates with greater confidence. Fast-food and table-service restaurants responded differently to the policy, with a small price increase and substantial increases in job tenure and in the proportion of full-time workers among fast-food restaurants, but not among table-service restaurants.},

Brazil also experienced a decline in returns to education, whereas an opposite trend was observed in several developed countries and China. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of educational, marital, and labor market factors on the income inequality of married couples. We also analyze how changes in educational assortative mating affect their income. Our findings suggest that changes in educational marital sorting parameters had a small but statistically significant effect on household income inequality. We show that growth in female labor force participation and a decrease in the gender wage gap explain part of the decline of the Gini coefficient. Educational factors also explain a part of that decline. Nevertheless, the main driver of the reduction in income inequality among couples appears to be the overall decrease in the returns to education.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Numerous ecological studies use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for exploratory analysis and data reduction. Determination of the number of components to retain is the most crucial problem confronting the researcher when using PCA. An incorrect choice may lead to the underextraction of components, but commonly results in overextraction. Of several methods proposed to determine the significance of principal components, Parallel Analysis (PA) has proven consistently accurate in determining the threshold for significant components, variable loadings, and analytical statistics when decomposing a correlation matrix. In this procedure, eigenvalues from a data set prior to rotation are compared with those from a matrix of random values of the same dimensionality (p variables and n samples). PCA eigenvalues from the data greater than PA eigenvalues from the corresponding random data can be retained. All components with eigenvalues below this threshold value should be considered spurious. We illustrate Parallel Analysis on an environmental data set. We reviewed all articles utilizing PCA or Factor Analysis (FA) from 1987 to 1993 from Ecology, Ecological Monographs, Journal of Vegetation Science and Journal of Ecology. Analyses were first separated into those PCA which decomposed a correlation matrix and those PCA which decomposed a covariance matrix. Parallel Analysis (PA) was applied for each PCA/FA found in the literature. Of 39 analy ses (in 22 articles), 29 (74.4 \%) considered no threshold rule, presumably retaining interpretable components. According to the PA results, 26 (66.7 \%) overextracted components. This overextraction may have resulted in potentially misleading interpretation of spurious components. It is suggested that the routine use of PA in multivariate ordination will increase confidence in the results and reduce the subjective interpretation of supposedly objective methods.},

In this paper, I extend this literature in two ways. First, I provide some simple underlying intuition for why difference-in-differences regression does not identify a group\texttimes period average treatment effect. Second, I propose an alternative twostage estimation framework, motivated by this intuition. In this framework, group and period effects are identified in a first stage from the sample of untreated observations, and average treatment effects are identified in a second stage by comparing treated and untreated outcomes, after removing these group and period effects. The two-stage approach is robust to treatment-effect heterogeneity under staggered adoption, and can be used to identify a host of different average treatment effect measures. It is also simple, intuitive, and easy to implement. I establish the theoretical properties of the two-stage approach and demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability using Monte-Carlo evidence and an example from the literature.},

A counterfactual analysis reveals that about two-thirds of the underrepresentation of non-Whites at higher-wage firms is explained by race-neutral skill-based sorting. Non-skill-based sorting and differential wage setting are largest for college-educated workers, suggesting that the allocative costs of discriminatory hiring and pay policies may be relatively large in Brazil.},

In this article, we examine minimum wage effects in low-wage counties, where relative minimum wage ratios reach as high as 0.82, well beyond the state-based ratios in extant studies. Using data from the American Community Survey, the Quarterly Workforce Indicators, and the Quarterly Census on Employment and Wages, we implement event study and difference-in-differences methods, estimating average causal effects for all events in our sample and separately for areas with lower and higher impacts. We find positive wage effects, especially in high-impact counties, but do not detect adverse effects on employment, weekly hours, or annual weeks worked. We do not find negative employment effects among women, Blacks, and/or Hispanics. In high-impact counties, we find substantial declines in household and child poverty.

The objective of this study was to examine several alternatives to index selection. Such procedures would potentially eliminate problems of selection associated with Smith-Hazel indices, including errors in genetic parameter estimates and difficulty in assigning relative economic weights to traits. Selection was performed on 1,280 plants that were evaluated over 2 years at 1 location, in a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates. The plants were evaluated for forage yield and several forage quality traits. The comparisons of index selection with principal factor analysis, maximum-likelihood factor analysis and principal component analysis were made for three sets of traits (five traits per set) to estimate repeatability for the comparisons. Multivariate analyses were performed on both simple and genotypic correlation matrices. Comparisons were made by computing Spearman's rank correlations between selection index plant scores and scores computed from multivariate analysis and by determining the number of plants selected in common for the selection methods. Among the three multivariate analysis methods evaluated in this study, principal component analysis had the highest correlation with index selection. The high correlation for principal component analysis of simple correlation matrices indicates the potential for using this statistical method for selection purposes. This would permit the breeder to reduce field costs (e.g., time, labor, equipment) required to obtain the genetic parameter estimates necessary to construct selection indices.},

  abstract = {The regional relationships between agglomeration and economic growth are expected to be different in different types of regions. In the literature of the new economic geography it is common to stress the importance of access to cities with agglomeration of economic activities in the form of firms and households in order to be able to explain regional growth. However, it is also well known that many rural areas are performing fairly well in terms of employment and economic opportunities.The purpose of the present research is to analyze if concentration of population drives economic growth or if it is the other way around. A second question is if this relationship between concentration of population and growth is different in different types of regions.In order to shed light on these two questions the economic performance of three types of Swedish regions (metropolitan-, cities- and rural regions) is related to changes in population densities.In the empirical analysis the Shannon index is used in the measurement of regional concentration. By considering the effect of previous levels of the Shannon index on average wages we extract information on how regional concentration affects regional economic growth (expressed as growth in average wages). In the empirical analysis we employ a VAR Granger causality approach on regional Swedish yearly data from 1987 to 2006. From this analysis we are able to conclude that there are strong empirical indications that geographic agglomeration of population unidirectionally drives economic growth in metropolitan- and city regions. Concerning the rural regions no such indication is found in either direction. This is a fairly strong indication that urban regions are more dependent on economies of agglomeration compared to rural areas.},

  abstract = {Variable selection has been suggested for Random Forests to improve data prediction and interpretation. However, the basic element, i.e. variable importance measures, cannot be computed straightforward when there are missing values in the predictor variables. Possible solutions are multiple imputation, complete case analysis and the use of a self-contained importance measure that is able to deal with missing values. Simulation and application studies have been conducted to investigate the properties of these procedures when combined with two popular variable selection methods. Findings and recommendations: Complete case analysis should not be used as it led to inaccurate variable selection. Multiple imputation is the method of choice if the selection of a variable is supposed to reflect its potential relevance in a complete data setting. However, Random Forests are commonly used without any preprocessing of the data as they are known to implicitly deal with missing values. In such a case, the application of the self-contained importance measure permits the selection of variables that are of relevance in these actual prediction models.},

  abstract = {In this work, it argues that the crisis of the city of Rio de Janeiro was characterized, besides the verified loss of their participation in the Brazilian economy, by the loss of its political and economic centrality. Rio de Janeiro was the first large urban-cosmopolitan center of the country. Throughout the first half of the XX century, however, the performance of the Sao Paulo economy fostered the emergence of an competitor urban center. With the transfer of the federal capital to Bras\'ilia, in the 1960s and 1970s, changed the compared competitive advantage between the two largest cities, retracting Rio economy with respect to S\~ao Paulo economy. Thus, agglomeration economies favored a vicious circle of deflation of the core activities of Rio de Janeiro. Qualitative research based on interviews reveal the importance of these factors in the decision of firms to leave the city, especially between the 1980s and 1990s. Currently, a series of events seems to promote a tipping point in the performance of Rio de Janeiro state economy. This new scenario may favor the recovery of the centrality of the city, although, until recently, with ambiguous results.},

There is no empirical consensus on whether the minimum wage has an equalizing effect on income distribution because of its ambiguous effects on employment. I document the effectiveness of the minimum wage on compressing wage inequality throughout the wage distribution and its effects on employment by using Brazilian regional data over the post-inflationary period (1995-2015). A counterfactual exercise shows that half of the decline in lower-tail inequality is attributable to the increase in the real minimum wage whereas the effects of the minimum wage on upper-tail inequality are negligible. Furthermore, the increase in the minimum wage has small contemporaneous adverse effects on formal employment which appear to vanish after three quarters.JEL classification: E24Keywords: wage inequality, employment, minimum wage.},

The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

I apply the method in the ``PNAD,'' a nationwide representative Brazilian cross-sectional dataset for the years 2001\textendash 2009. The results indicate that the size of the informal sector is increased by around 39\% compared to what would prevail in the absence of the minimum wage, an effect attributable to (i) unemployment effects of the minimum wage on the formal sector and (ii) movements of workers from the formal to the informal sector as a response to the policy.},

Such an examination is rare in the extant literature and it is timely given the increasing debate concerning the stimulus versus inflationary effects arising from wage polices because of COVID-19 global pandemic. We apply the autoregressive distributed lag model to determine the causal relationship between these variables. We find one long-run cointegrating relationship that runs from the real minimum wage to the real retail trade sales. In addition, we find that a 1\% increase in the minimum wage is associated with almost a 0.5\% increase in real retail trade sales in the long run. While our findings rest on several statistical assumptions, there is strong evidence in support of the position that minimum wage strengthens aggregate consumer spending, and thereby the standard of living, economic growth and stability. This is a position that differs from the conclusions drawn from mainstream academic and policy debates on the economic usefulness and efficacy of minimum wage increases., JEL Codes: C30, E21, E24},

  abstract = {Abstract: Labor productivity is a crucial long-run determinant of real wages. Nonetheless, wage and productivity dynamics often diverge in practice due to a range of economic and institutional factors. This study analyzes the relation between the dynamics of labor productivity and wages in Brazil from 1996 to 2014, and adopts a sectoral perspective to account for divergent trends among economic sectors. Analyses are based on pooled data drawn from the National Accounts and the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domic\'ilios, and hierarchical data models are estimated to assess the impacts of state- and sector-level factors on individuals' wages. Results indicate that productivity is significantly positively associated with wage levels for all economic sectors, but that institutional factors such as labor formalization and minimum wage exert equally significant impacts, suggesting that wage growth over the 1996-2014 period was as much the result of institutional changes as of transformation of Brazil's productive structure.},

  abstract = {We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its intended goal \textemdash{} thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

Since increases of the minimum wage occurred in different months over the years, we can identify its effect on inequality even after controlling for month dummies. Our method avoids problems of decomposition-order dependence since other possible determinants of inequality, such as education and wage structure, remain constant over short periods of time. In addition, the method avoids spillover effects because we do not use workers in specific percentiles as control groups. Our results indicate that minimum wage increases explain all the reduction in wage inequality in Brazil between 2002 and 2013 and affected workers in different percentiles. Moreover, the effects were persistent over time did not cause adverse effects on employment.},

This paper estimates the minimum wage price effect using monthly Brazilian household and firm data from 1982 to 2000 aggregated at a regional level. Empirical evidence on price effects will help to answer the question of who pays for the higher costs: firms, consumers or the unemployed. The answer to this question is a contribution to the controversial recent debate in the literature over the direction of the minimum wage employment effect. Employment might not be affected if firms are able to pass through to prices the higher labour costs associated to a minimum wage increase. In that case, consumers pay for the increase. Furthermore, if the poor consumers are those buying minimum wage labour intensive goods, or if these goods represent a large proportion of their consumption bundle, then minimum wage increases might hurt rather than aid the poor. Moreover, if minimum wage increases cause inflation, they will hurt the poor further, who disproportionately suffer from it. Robust results indicate that the minimum wage raises overall prices in Brazil. The resulting inflation is slightly higher for the poor than for the rich in the long run, smaller in low inflation periods, and larger in poorer regions.},

We aimed to provide guidance for drawing conclusions from data with a large proportion of missingness. Study Design and Setting Via simulations, we investigated how the proportion of missing data, the fraction of missing information (FMI), and availability of auxiliary variables affected MI performance. Outcome data were missing completely at random or missing at random (MAR). Results Provided sufficient auxiliary information was available; MI was beneficial in terms of bias and never detrimental in terms of efficiency. Models with similar FMI values, but differing proportions of missing data, also had similar precision for effect estimates. In the absence of bias, the FMI was a better guide to the efficiency gains using MI than the proportion of missing data. Conclusion We provide evidence that for MAR data, valid MI reduces bias even when the proportion of missingness is large. We advise researchers to use FMI to guide choice of auxiliary variables for efficiency gain in imputation analyses, and that sensitivity analyses including different imputation models may be needed if the number of complete cases is small.},

Seeking to fill this gap for the case of Brazil, the paper revisits household survey data from 1996 to 2015 with propensity score (PS) and nearest-neighbour (NN) matching techniques. As results, the discriminatory component was confirmed to be significant in all years and not to follow a systematic decaying trend across the years \textendash{} the fall observed from 1996 to 2004 was offset in 65\% by a subsequent increase. Gender discrimination was heterogeneous throughout occupational categories, being especially high in management positions. Estimates, albeit belonging to the range of previous studies, also challenged the gap closing trend suggested by these studies.

Argumenta-se que a grande recess\~ao foi causada pela queda acentuada dos gastos de investimento ao longo do ano 2014, cuja origem se encontra na redu\c{c}\~ao das margens de lucro das empresas n\~ao financeiras decorrente da eleva\c{c}\~ao do custo unit\'ario do trabalho e da sobrevaloriza\c{c}\~ao da taxa de c\^ambio. Os efeitos recessivos do colapso do investimento foram amplificados pelo realinhamento brusco dos pre\c{c}os relativos ocorrido no primeiro semestre de 2015, e pela contra\c{c}\~ao fiscal executada pelo Minist\'erio da Fazenda no primeiro ano do segundo mandato da presidente Dilma Rousseff. A realiza\c{c}\~ao de uma contra\c{c}\~ao fiscal no meio de uma recess\~ao foi, contudo, decorr\^encia da "perda de espa\c{c}o fiscal" causada pela tend\^encia de redu\c{c}\~ao do resultado prim\'ario estrutural observada desde 2007. A supera\c{c}\~ao da atual crise econ\^omica exige a recupera\c{c}\~ao das margens de lucro das empresas n\~ao financeiras, o que requer uma mudan\c{c}a na regra de reajuste do sal\'ario m\'inimo, a continuidade da flexibiliza\c{c}\~ao da pol\'itica monet\'aria e a ado\c{c}\~ao de um imposto de exporta\c{c}\~ao de commodities.

  abstract = {Minimum wage laws have become one of the most debated state interventions in the economy, being considered by many specialists as a very efficient tool used to correct certain labour market failures. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between minimum wage and employment dynamics, with a special focus on some vulnerable categories recognized in the literature (young people, female workers, the elderly, etc.). Thus, we analysed the relation between the dynamics of minimum wages and that of employment in 22 EU countries, panel data (1999\textendash{} 2016). The results suggest a negative impact of the minimum wage on total employment and on sensitive categories (youth, female workers, the elderly). The long-running negative impact holds for all but one group (55\textendash 64 years). The models were tested for random and fixed effects and the results were correspondingly adjusted with country and time and random and fixed effects. Cointegration tests and the tests using lagged minimum wage also confirm a robust relationship between the dynamics of the minimum wage and that of employment over time. Our findings are consistent with many previous studies and confirm the recommendations to prudently use this public policy tool. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Background: The association between development and entrepreneurship has been addressed in multiple works as an unidirectional relationship, whether it is to explain development through entrepreneurship or viceversa. For this reason, the fundamental objective of the document is to advance a little more and evaluate for Colombia the link between the development of the regions and their degree of entrepreneurship as an endogenous or feedback relationship. Methods: The per capita gdp and the occupation volume are taken as indicators of the level of regional development, while for the Entrepreneurship Index uses the rate of employers and workers own account with a high level of human capital. Subsequently, simultaneous equation models are contrasted by the method of least squares in three stages (LS3S), where the variables explained are the regional development and the degree of entrepreneurship. Results: There is evidence of an endogenous and positive relationship between both factors, entrepreneurship has a positive impact on regional development, in turn, the level of regional development positively affects entrepreneurship. Conclusions: In addition to the traditional sources of development considered in this article, entrepreneurship is a fundamental component when planning regional development. A raise in the participation of self-employment associated with the occupational categories of employers and self-employed with a high level of education is a strategy that, according to the results of this document, allows to generate a dynamic of positive feedback with economic activity.},

We find that the NMW increased average labour costs for companies that tend to employ low paid workers, both upon the introduction of the NMW and more recently following the Great Recession when many workers experienced pay freezes or wage cuts, but the NMW continued to rise. We find evidence to suggest that companies responded to these increases in labour costs by raising labour productivity. These labour productivity changes did not appear to come about via a reduction in firms' workforce or via capital-labour substitution. Rather they were associated with increases in total factor productivity, as theories of organisational change, training and efficiency wages would suggest.},

Using data drawn from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1979 to 2012, I find no evidence that minimum wage increases were associated with changes in overall state GDP. However, this null finding masks substantial heterogeneity in the productivity effects of minimum wages across industries and over the business cycle. Difference-in-difference-in-difference estimates suggest that a 10\% increase in the minimum wage is associated with a short-run 1\% to 2\% decline in state GDP generated by lower-skilled industries relative to more highly skilled industries. This differential appears larger during troughs as compared to that during peaks of the state business cycle. (JEL J3, J4, L5)},

Results of panel cointegration test show that variables of labor market institutions are not robustly correlated to macroeconomic outcomes in the long run. This condition is not in accordance with the findings of the proponents and critics of wage-led growth. No robust evidence exists to show that increasing minimum wage and union density, which are representative policies for wage-led growth, are correlated to inequality, labor income share, consumption, investment, or growth in the long run.

Latin America's largest economy offers a fertile setting for shedding light on the issue, in being a large and data-rich country where frequent increases in the minimum wage can allow for direct estimation of influence on the distribution of income. Using a difference-in-difference estimator that takes advantage of substantial regional income variation and 21 increases in the Brazilian national wage floor, the study finds that within three months of these minimum wage hikes, poverty and inequality declined by 2.8\% and 2.4\%, respectively. Influence waned over time, particularly with respect to bottom-sensitive distribution measures, a development that is consistent with resulting job loses that fell more heavily among poorer households. The fact that the following annual hike in the minimum wage led to a renewed decline in poverty and inequality, suggests that potential unemployment costs were again overwhelmed by benefits in the form of higher wages among working individuals. However, evidence also establishes an inelastic relationship between wage floor hikes and changes in the incidence of poverty, as well as diminishing returns to the strategy when the legal minimum is high relative to median earnings.},

  abstract = {An economic crisis may have originated in the internal macroeconomic conditions or changes in the environment / international economic structure. The recent Brazilian crisis, which began in 2014, had as its main features, a lack of inflation and public accounts, which required a contractionary monetary policy, resulting in one of the most intense and prolonged recessions in Brazilian economic history. In parallel, the international economic situation proved to be very adverse, with fluctuations in commodity prices, the end of the Quantitative Easing program in the US and a relative loss of momentum in the global economy, despite the US economic recovery. In this context, this study aims to evaluate whether internal factors, such as the Brazilian interest rates and gross fixed capital formation, among others or external factors, such as commodity prices and global economic growth, may have affected Brazilian economic performance. For its methodology, the research uses precedence tests in order to verify that the internal and external determinants preceded it, ``in the sense of Granger,'' the Brazilian GDP. Among the findings of the research, it was possible to identify both internal nature of variables and external nature preceded the Brazilian GDP, suggesting that the crisis originated from a combination of domestic and external factors.},

However, the collection of accurate income and consumption data requires extensive resources for household surveys. Given the increasingly routine application of principal components analysis (PCA) using asset data in creating socio-economic status (SES) indices, we review how PCA-based indices are constructed, how they can be used, and their validity and limitations. Specifically, issues related to choice of variables, data preparation and problems such as data clustering are addressed. Interpretation of results and methods of classifying households into SES groups are also discussed. PCA has been validated as a method to describe SES differentiation within a population. Issues related to the underlying data will affect PCA and this should be considered when generating and interpreting results.},

This paper develops a simple two-period overlapping generation model with three economic policies, minimum wage, unemployment benefit, and public investment that improves labor productivity. The government imposes tax on firms to finance public capital and unemployment benefit under a balanced budget. We show that economic growth is promoted with an increase in minimum wage and the ratio of public investment to tax revenue.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

  abstract = {Significant changes have taken place in the spatial structure of the Russian economy since the launch of market reforms. The paper studies its peculiarities in 1999\textendash 2013 in terms of formal (recorded by statistics in current prices) and real changes in the spatial structure of the economy. The relevant performance is calculated from real GRP indices, changes in the number of employed in the economy, and the dynamics in electric energy consumption. It is concluded that real changes in the spatial structure of the economy are much less significant than those recorded in statistics. This can be attributed to the fact that the region whose economic results have been recorded does not always coincide with the region where goods are actually produced and transported. Another aspect of the problem is demonstrated: a very high interregional differentiation in the indicators of per capita GRP. The main reason for this differentiation stems from the huge disparities in the indicators of value added per employee according to types of economic activity. Some of these comparable indicators have only been used in Russian statistics since 2005. Labor productivity indicators for different types of activities differ by more than an order of magnitude. Lists of leaders (mining, financial activity, and wholesale trade) and outliers (agriculture, education, and healthcare) do not change with time. For the most part, these differences cannot be removed; because of this and the almost complete resistant to changes characterizing the current specialization of regions, no significant changes in the existing regional differences can be expected in the long run in terms of per capita production. \textcopyright{} 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},
